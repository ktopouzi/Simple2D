# Simple2D
A very simple 2D game.

_**The name or the contents of the game are still in development. Nothing is specified and everything can change. The progress of the game is not determined and it could take a lot of time and effort for this to be prototyped or finished.**_

_**The theme of the game is for now a stylized forest and the character of the game is not yet determined, but will probably be something that fits in a forest. Nothing is final and everything can change in the process.**_

_Footage is coming later. First i must decide the game concept and the basic movement(done) and game-play._
